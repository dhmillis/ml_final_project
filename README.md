The easiest way to see my report will be to open the file final_report_03.pdf. If you click on the pdf file name in my GitHub repository, and then click the View Raw link or the Raw button, GitHub will let you download the file. You can then view it in Acrobat Reader or any other pdf reader.

Sorry, I could not figure out how to use gh-pages. I created the pdf file by selecting the Knit PDF option in RStudio. The pdf file and the html file were "knitted" from the same Rmd file. I hope that having the pdf file available will make it easy enough for graders to read my report.
