Coursera Machine Learning Project

The easiest way to see my report will be to open the file final_report_03.pdf.

Sorry, I could not figure out how to use gh-pages. I created the pdf file by selecting the Knit PDF option in RStudio. I hope that having this file available will make it easy enough for graders to read my report.
